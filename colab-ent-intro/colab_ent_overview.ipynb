    "# Cleaning Up\n",
    "In the Google Colab Enterprise environment, packages are installed within the runtime context. This means that any packages installed in one session attached to a specific runtime will be visible and accessible from a different session connected to that same runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any conflicts or issues with package versions in future sessions, it is recommended to delete the runtime instance after you finish your work. This will ensure that your environment is clean and does not retain any experimental changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete the runtime instance, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Navigate to `Colab Enterprise` tab (`Vertex AI` -> `Colab Enterprise` if you are not in the `Colab Enterprise` section already) \n",
    "2. Open `Runtimes` tab (direct link: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/runtimes)\n",
    "3. Find the runtime you want to delete and delete it"
