    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a comprehensive guide to managing and enriching product data using Google Cloud services, primarily focusing on Vertex AI and BigQuery. You will learn how to perform essential data operations, from initial setup and authentication to advanced data enrichment using Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:**\n",
    "*   Fetching and analyzing product data from BigQuery.\n",
    "*   Utilizing Generative AI (Gemini models) for:\n",
    "    *   Extracting brand names from product titles.\n",
    "    *   Generating compelling product descriptions.\n",
    "    *   Creating relevant product tags.\n",
    "    *   Consolidating and normalizing product tags.\n",
    "    *   Identifying color attributes (color families and specific colors).\n",
    "*   Creating and populating an enhanced product table in BigQuery with the newly generated attributes.\n",
    "*   Verifying the data enrichment process.\n",
    "*   Uploading the enriched product data to product catalog.\n",
    "*   Validating the enriched data through Validation tool of Vertex AI Search for commererce.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Learnings:**\n",
    "Upon completing this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "*   Query and analyze product data stored in BigQuery.\n",
    "*   Leverage Generative AI models for various product data enrichment tasks, including attribute extraction and content generation.\n",
    "*   Manage and update BigQuery table schemas and data, including creating tables, copying data, and merging updates.\n",
    "*   Understand the practical application of AI in enhancing e-commerce product catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "*   **Setup**: Prepare the Python environment, authenticate with Google Cloud, install required packages, and define global variables and utility functions. This ensures the notebook can interact with GCP services and process data efficiently.\n",
    "*   **Data Analysis**: Analyze the initial product data from BigQuery to understand its current state, schema, and identify missing attributes (e.g., brand, description, tags, detailed color information) that can be enriched.\n",
    "*   **Data Enrichment using Generative AI**:\n",
    "    *   Perform preliminary token analysis on product titles to identify potential values for simpler attributes.\n",
    "    *   Populate `patterns`, `sizes`, and `audience` fields based on the token analysis.\n",
    "    *   Use the Gemini model to extract `brand` names from product titles.\n",
    "    *   Generate compelling `description` fields for products using their titles.\n",
    "    *   Generate product `tags` based on titles and descriptions, then consolidate these tags to create a more refined and manageable set.\n",
    "    *   Extract `colorInfo` (color families and specific colors) from product titles.\n",
    "*   **Store Enriched Data in BigQuery**:\n",
    "    *   Create a new table (`products_enhanced`) in BigQuery by cloning the original product table.\n",
    "    *   Extend the schema of this new table to include the newly generated attributes.\n",
    "    *   Populate the new attributes in the `products_enhanced` table using the data generated in the enrichment phase (from the `df_products` DataFrame).\n",
    "*   **Verification**:\n",
    "    *   Load the enriched product data from the `products_enhanced` BigQuery table into a new branch (Branch 2) of the Vertex AI Search for Commerce catalog.\n",
    "    *   Validate the data enrichment by performing search queries against both the original catalog (Branch 0) and the enriched catalog (Branch 2) using the Vertex AI Search for Commerce console, observing differences in search results and facet availability.\n",

The `project_id` variable will be used throughout the notebook.\n",

    "    You are an expert data normalizer specializing in e-commerce product tags.\n",
    "    Your task is to consolidate a list of product tags to reduce variability and group semantically similar tags under a single canonical form.\n",

    "    2. Identify groups of tags that are synonyms, misspellings, plural/singular variations, or closely related concepts.\n",
    "    3. For each group, suggest a single, concise, and representative canonical tag.\n",
    "    4. If a tag is already in a good canonical form or is unique and distinct, it can map to itself.\n",
    "    5. Prioritize broader terms if multiple specific terms can be grouped (e.g., \"hdmi cable,\" \"usb cable\" could remain distinct or be grouped under \"cables\" if very aggressive consolidation is needed, but for now, try to keep meaningful distinctions unless they are very minor variations).\n",
    "    6. Ensure the canonical tag is in lowercase.\n",
    "    7. Remove the tags that are too generic or not useful for search (e.g., \"product\", \"item\", \"thing\", \"location\") unless they are part of a meaningful tag.\n",
    "    8. Try to generate tags that are non-overlapping and distinct, avoiding redundancy.\n",
    "    9. When you generate an initial list of canonical tags, ensure they are distinct and meaningful, perform another iteration of analysis based on the rules above, to avoid redundancy.\n",
    "    10. Return the results as a JSON map where the key is the original tag from the input batch and the value is its suggested canonical tag.\n",

    "    *   The schema of the newly cloned `products_enhanced` table is extended. This involves adding new columns required to store the enriched product attributes (such as brands, description, tags, and color information) that are not present in the original table. The complete target schema, inclusive of these new fields, is typically predefined (e.g., loaded from a GCS file).\n",

    "        *   Preparing the enriched data (e.g., from the `df_products` Pandas DataFrame).\n",
    "        *   Loading this prepared data into a temporary BigQuery table.\n",
    "        *   Executing a `MERGE` operation to update the `products_enhanced` table, matching records by product ID and filling in the values for the extended attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Verification and Cleanup:**\n",
    "    *   Post-population, a verification step is performed by querying a sample of the updated records to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "    *   Any temporary resources, such as the intermediate table used for the merge, are cleaned up."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this lab, we successfully demonstrated how to manage and enrich product data using Google Cloud services, particularly focusing on Vertex AI and BigQuery. We covered the following key steps:\n",
    "-   **Data Analysis**: We analyzed the existing product data to identify gaps and opportunities for enrichment.\n",
    "-   **Data Enrichment**: We utilized Generative AI models to extract structured information from product titles, generating attributes such as brand names, descriptions, tags, and color information.\n",
    "-   **Data Population**: We created a new BigQuery table to store the enriched product data, ensuring that all original fields and newly generated attributes were included.\n",
    "-   **Data Validation**: We validated the enriched product data using the Vertex AI Search for Commerce validation tool, ensuring that the data met our expectations and was ready for use in search and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas for Improvement**:\n",
    "-   **Image Analysis**: In this lab, we focused on text data for simplicity. Future iterations could incorporate image analysis to extract additional attributes from product images, enhancing the catalog further.\n",
    "-   **Attributes Cleansing**: while we consolidated tags and extracted colors, further cleansing and normalization of attributes could improve data quality. For example, ensuring consistent naming conventions for brands and colors, standardizing sizing, genders, and audience attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operationalization**:\n",
    "In this lab we demonstrated an approach to improve product data quality and searchability in iterative manner. The steps we followed can be operationalized in a production environment. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use the [BigQuery Pipelines](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/pipelines-introduction), as it supports direct execution of notebooks. Another approach is to transform the notebook into a Python script or PySpark jobs that can be scheduled to run periodically through Cloud Scheduler or BigQuery scheduled queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of Generative AI**:\n",
    "Generative AI played a crucial role in this lab by enabling us to extract structured information from unstructured text data. Not only that, the entire codebase in this notebook was generated using Gemini model, which demonstrates the power of Generative AI in automating and enhancing data management tasks. The code operationalization can also be done with help of Generative AI. \n"
